## Key Findings
- The overall approval rate is 0.04%, indicating highly selective criteria.
- Slightly higher approval rates are observed among applicants with higher education, specific housing types, and certain family compositions.
- Interactive filtering allows isolating and comparing approval performance across different demographic groups.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA dashboard provides an overview of the dataset structure and distribution, highlighting key variables such as income, age, education, and approval outcomes.  It identifies trends, potential outliers, and demographic imbalances to support informed feature selection and guide downstream analysis.
